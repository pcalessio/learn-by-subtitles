1
00:04:58,033 --> 00:05:03,393
Waft your waves, ye waters!
Carry your crests to the cradle!

2
00:05:10,499 --> 00:05:14,539
- Are you watching alone?
- With you there'd be two of us

3
00:05:15,966 --> 00:05:18,656
- Let's see how you watch
- Safe from you

4
00:05:21,633 --> 00:05:27,023
- Heiaha! Sprightly sisters!
- Help me capture Woglinde

5
00:05:32,466 --> 00:05:35,656
Badly you guard the gold

6
00:05:37,632 --> 00:05:42,232
Watch better or you'll repent

7
00:06:13,932 --> 00:06:16,622
Hey, nymphs!
How inviting you look

8
00:06:17,899 --> 00:06:22,089
From Nibelheim I'd gladly draw near
if you'd but come down to me

9
00:06:24,266 --> 00:06:26,956
See who's spying on us!

10
00:06:30,099 --> 00:06:32,589
- Ugh! How frightful!
- Guard the gold!

11
00:06:33,832 --> 00:06:35,562
Father warned us of a foe

12
00:06:41,032 --> 00:06:42,992
- You up there!
- What do you want?

13
00:06:43,966 --> 00:06:46,806
Do I spoil your sport by staring?

14
00:06:48,666 --> 00:06:52,676
If you'd come down, the Nibelung
would freely frolic with you

15
00:06:55,166 --> 00:06:56,686
Is he in jest?

16
00:06:58,099 --> 00:06:59,849
How brightly you shine!

17
00:07:01,066 --> 00:07:05,166
My arms would love to enfold
one of you

18
00:07:07,966 --> 00:07:11,276
Now I laugh at my fears!
Our foe is in love!

19
00:07:12,499 --> 00:07:14,669
- Lascivious beast!
- We'll teach him!

20
00:07:17,632 --> 00:07:21,322
- She's coming down
- Come close to me, then!

21
00:07:30,999 --> 00:07:33,189
Loathsome slime!

22
00:07:36,532 --> 00:07:38,812
My hands and feet are slipping!

23
00:07:40,566 --> 00:07:41,966
Damp fills my nostrils

24
00:07:45,499 --> 00:07:46,579
Curse this sneezing!

25
00:07:47,899 --> 00:07:50,179
My wooer comes spluttering!

26
00:07:52,899 --> 00:07:54,859
Be my love, fairest child!

27
00:07:56,466 --> 00:07:58,986
Woo me up here!

28
00:08:03,499 --> 00:08:07,859
Alas, come back!
What you manage is hard for me

29
00:08:09,866 --> 00:08:11,916
Climb to the bottom!
You'll catch me there!

30
00:08:12,799 --> 00:08:15,519
- Better down there!
- But now up again!

31
00:08:18,699 --> 00:08:22,449
How can I catch this bashful fish?
Wait, false one!

32
00:08:26,999 --> 00:08:31,219
Hey, beloved!
Don't you hear me?

33
00:08:33,199 --> 00:08:34,749
Is it me you're calling?

34
00:08:39,432 --> 00:08:42,272
Turn to me.
Do not heed Woglinde!

35
00:08:44,099 --> 00:08:48,109
You are far lovelier.
That shy one is much too sly

36
00:08:51,632 --> 00:08:53,382
Come down if you'd delight me

37
00:08:55,332 --> 00:08:57,352
- Am I close to you now?
- Not close enough!

38
00:08:59,732 --> 00:09:01,632
Twine your arms around me ...

39
00:09:03,366 --> 00:09:05,386
... that I may touch your neck ...

40
00:09:06,466 --> 00:09:09,806
... and caress your soft breast

41
00:09:12,199 --> 00:09:15,009
If you're longing for love ...

42
00:09:16,866 --> 00:09:20,586
... let's see what you look like

43
00:09:23,999 --> 00:09:25,929
Ugh, you hairy horror!

44
00:09:26,899 --> 00:09:28,769
Swarthy, sulphurous dwarf!

45
00:09:31,732 --> 00:09:34,162
Find yourself a sweetheart
who'd suffer you!

46
00:09:35,432 --> 00:09:37,802
Though I don't please,
I'll hold you

47
00:09:39,099 --> 00:09:41,559
Fast then, or I'll fly

48
00:09:48,066 --> 00:09:49,996
Perfidious child! Frigid fish!

49
00:09:51,766 --> 00:09:54,316
If I don't seem handsome,
suave and sprightly ...

50
00:09:56,266 --> 00:09:58,876
... then flirt with the eels!

51
00:10:04,499 --> 00:10:06,669
So soon disheartened?

52
00:10:08,432 --> 00:10:10,422
You've courted two

53
00:10:11,432 --> 00:10:14,012
If you asked the third ...

54
00:10:16,032 --> 00:10:21,332
... blissful balm she'd bestow

55
00:10:23,399 --> 00:10:26,859
A sweet song sounds in my ear

56
00:10:29,566 --> 00:10:35,196
How good there are more of you!
There must be one I'd please

57
00:10:38,866 --> 00:10:40,386
If I'm to believe you, come down!

58
00:10:46,832 --> 00:10:50,842
How stupid you are, sisters!
Don't you think him handsome?

59
00:10:53,032 --> 00:10:56,952
I think them stupid and ugly
since I saw you, the fairest

60
00:10:58,366 --> 00:11:03,086
Sing on. That song tempts my ear

61
00:11:04,666 --> 00:11:09,616
My heart hammers and shivers
in pleasure at such praise

62
00:11:11,532 --> 00:11:14,192
Your grace rejoices my eyes

63
00:11:17,599 --> 00:11:20,439
Your smile rejoices my spirit

64
00:11:22,432 --> 00:11:24,682
- Dearest of men!
- Sweetest of maids!

65
00:11:25,699 --> 00:11:28,309
- Would you but favour me!
- I'd hold you for ever

66
00:11:30,132 --> 00:11:34,642
Might I ever see your piercing gaze
and clasp your bristly beard!

67
00:11:36,299 --> 00:11:40,809
Might your wiry hair flow
round me for ever

68
00:11:42,299 --> 00:11:44,439
Might I see only
your toad-like form ...

69
00:11:45,932 --> 00:11:48,862
... and hear your croaking voice!

70
00:11:52,299 --> 00:11:57,519
- Do you mock me?
- How justly at the song's end!

71
00:12:01,899 --> 00:12:06,499
Alas! Woe is me!

72
00:12:08,032 --> 00:12:11,902
Has the third betrayed me too?

73
00:12:14,965 --> 00:12:17,575
You sly, sluttish wenches!

74
00:12:19,499 --> 00:12:22,019
Do you feed only on fraud?

75
00:12:28,099 --> 00:12:31,699
Heia! For shame, gnome!
Don't scold down there!

76
00:12:36,265 --> 00:12:38,485
Listen to what we tell you!

77
00:12:40,165 --> 00:12:44,205
Why did you not secure
the maid for whom you yearned?

78
00:12:45,432 --> 00:12:49,502
We are faithful
to the wooer who holds us fast

79
00:12:52,832 --> 00:12:56,672
Seize on us and do not fear.
In the water we cannot escape

80
00:13:05,765 --> 00:13:08,755
Through me an ardent fire burns

81
00:13:10,965 --> 00:13:13,275
Fury and longing surge
through my spirit

82
00:13:16,065 --> 00:13:22,335
Though you laugh, I long for you
and one of you must yield to me!

83
00:14:24,999 --> 00:14:27,309
If this fist could seize one!

84
00:15:01,332 --> 00:15:03,882
Look, the sun laughs in the depths

85
00:15:09,165 --> 00:15:13,645
Through the green waters
she greets the sleeper

86
00:15:19,799 --> 00:15:23,279
Now she kisses his eyes open

87
00:15:25,099 --> 00:15:29,109
See, he smiles in the light

88
00:15:30,599 --> 00:15:34,029
His rays flood through the waters

89
00:15:55,565 --> 00:16:00,985
Rhinegold! Dazzling delight!

90
00:16:04,665 --> 00:16:08,205
Your glow spreads a glorious light

91
00:16:13,665 --> 00:16:16,245
Awake, friend, to joy!

92
00:16:18,032 --> 00:16:26,592
The river flashes as we dance
and sing in our joyous sport

93
00:16:33,899 --> 00:16:37,499
Rhinegold! Heiajahei!

94
00:17:01,065 --> 00:17:04,255
What is it that gleams there?

95
00:17:06,665 --> 00:17:10,825
Whence come you that you have
never heard of the Rhinegold?

96
00:17:15,232 --> 00:17:20,242
Does the gnome know nothing of the
eyes of gold that wake and sleep?

97
00:17:21,632 --> 00:17:27,432
Of the star in the depths
that shines through the waves?

98
00:17:30,398 --> 00:17:33,588
See how we bask in its glow!

99
00:17:35,632 --> 00:17:40,672
If you wish, sport with us!

100
00:17:52,998 --> 00:17:56,898
Gold only for games
would be little use to me

101
00:17:58,832 --> 00:18:05,422
He would not scorn the gold
if he were aware of its wonders

102
00:18:07,932 --> 00:18:11,182
He could win the world's wealth
if from the Rhinegold ...

103
00:18:12,398 --> 00:18:15,768
... he fashioned the ring that
confers immeasurable might

104
00:18:18,098 --> 00:18:20,058
Father ordered us ...

105
00:18:21,798 --> 00:18:24,898
... to guard the treasure

106
00:18:26,532 --> 00:18:31,572
No cheat should ravish it.
So hush, you chatterers!

107
00:18:32,965 --> 00:18:39,885
Do you not know to whom alone
it is given to shape the gold?

108
00:18:49,232 --> 00:18:53,272
Only he who forswears ...

109
00:18:58,065 --> 00:19:01,905
... love's power and delight

110
00:19:04,498 --> 00:19:10,918
Only he can attain the magic
to fashion the gold into a ring

111
00:19:17,398 --> 00:19:23,488
Then we are secure.
Everything that lives wants love

112
00:19:25,198 --> 00:19:27,478
No one will reject it

113
00:19:29,598 --> 00:19:34,958
Least of all that lascivious gnome

114
00:19:37,832 --> 00:19:43,052
I do not fear him as I found him.
His passion almost burned me

115
00:19:46,098 --> 00:19:51,958
Like a brand in the waves,
he was sizzling with love

116
00:19:58,465 --> 00:20:03,855
Dear gnome, why don't you laugh?

117
00:20:06,665 --> 00:20:09,155
In the glow how fair you shine!

118
00:20:10,832 --> 00:20:13,872
Come, beloved, laugh with us!

119
00:20:46,165 --> 00:20:48,975
The world's wealth
I could win through you?

120
00:20:51,498 --> 00:20:55,188
If I cannot extort love,
can I by cunning attain pleasure?

121
00:21:05,065 --> 00:21:08,605
Mock on!
The Nibelung nears your toy!

122
00:21:14,265 --> 00:21:17,305
Save yourselves!
The gnome has gone crazy!

123
00:21:19,432 --> 00:21:22,942
Love has sent him mad!

124
00:21:26,065 --> 00:21:29,875
Are you still not afraid?
Then coquette in the dark!

125
00:21:36,498 --> 00:21:39,748
I will put out your light ...

126
00:21:41,365 --> 00:21:44,295
... wrench the gold from
the rock ...

127
00:21:45,465 --> 00:21:49,415
... forge the ring of revenge

128
00:21:51,698 --> 00:21:55,678
Hear me, waves!

129
00:22:00,265 --> 00:22:04,985
Thus I curse love!

130
00:22:14,565 --> 00:22:15,585
Stop, thief!

131
00:22:16,431 --> 00:22:19,651
- Rescue the gold!
- Help!

132
00:26:18,531 --> 00:26:20,991
Wotan, husband, awake!

133
00:26:28,698 --> 00:26:33,448
Gate and door guard
the sacred hall of my joy

134
00:26:37,331 --> 00:26:43,951
Man's honour, eternal might
extend to endless fame

135
00:26:50,831 --> 00:26:52,231
Up, leave dream's deceit!

136
00:26:53,698 --> 00:26:56,098
Rouse yourself and reflect!

137
00:27:12,231 --> 00:27:17,561
The everlasting work is done

138
00:27:27,165 --> 00:27:33,405
The god's stronghold soars
resplendent

139
00:27:36,431 --> 00:27:39,681
As in my dreams I desired it ...

140
00:27:42,565 --> 00:27:45,905
... as my will directed ...

141
00:27:48,631 --> 00:27:53,791
... strong and fair it stands ...

142
00:28:01,598 --> 00:28:04,378
... sublime, superb!

143
00:28:16,131 --> 00:28:20,031
Do you delight in what I dread?

144
00:28:22,331 --> 00:28:24,581
I fear for Freia

145
00:28:25,998 --> 00:28:29,778
Reckless man, recall the price

146
00:28:32,698 --> 00:28:36,678
The fort is finished:
forfeit is the pledge

147
00:28:43,398 --> 00:28:45,918
I well know the terms

148
00:28:48,498 --> 00:28:49,898
By a contract ...

149
00:28:51,731 --> 00:28:56,971
... I tamed those
that built this abode

150
00:28:59,864 --> 00:29:05,664
Now it stands, thanks to them.
As to the price, pay that no heed

151
00:29:07,931 --> 00:29:11,271
Outrageous levity!

152
00:29:13,198 --> 00:29:17,008
Had I known of your contract,
I would have prevented the fraud

153
00:29:18,531 --> 00:29:26,031
You men kept women away
to deal alone with the giants

154
00:29:30,331 --> 00:29:35,841
Shamelessly you bartered
Freia, my lovely sister

155
00:29:39,731 --> 00:29:43,041
What do you men hold sacred ...

156
00:29:45,931 --> 00:29:48,071
... when you thirst for power?

157
00:29:52,331 --> 00:29:56,341
Was Fricka free from thirst ...

158
00:29:58,664 --> 00:30:01,704
... when she begged
for the building?

159
00:30:06,598 --> 00:30:10,348
Concern over his constancy ...

160
00:30:11,998 --> 00:30:19,088
... makes me ponder how
to keep him ...

161
00:30:23,898 --> 00:30:26,178
... when he is drawn to roam

162
00:30:31,564 --> 00:30:36,634
A stately dwelling might tempt you
to tarry here and rest

163
00:30:39,264 --> 00:30:45,354
You thought only of defences
to increase your power

164
00:30:49,631 --> 00:30:51,851
Only to arouse storms ...

165
00:30:53,664 --> 00:30:57,064
... did this castle arise

166
00:31:00,498 --> 00:31:04,008
You wished to keep me in the castle

167
00:31:09,031 --> 00:31:16,241
But even as a god confined,
I must win the outside world

168
00:31:19,331 --> 00:31:23,551
All who live love roaming

169
00:31:26,631 --> 00:31:29,441
I cannot relinquish this sport

170
00:31:31,531 --> 00:31:37,241
Unloving man!
For the toys of dominion ...

171
00:31:40,264 --> 00:31:43,804
... would you stake
love and a woman's worth?

172
00:31:53,364 --> 00:32:01,424
To win you for my wife
I sacrificed one of my eyes

173
00:32:08,198 --> 00:32:11,888
I prize women
more than pleases you!

174
00:32:15,231 --> 00:32:19,891
And I will not yield Freia.
I never intended it so

175
00:32:27,531 --> 00:32:29,431
Then protect her now!

176
00:32:36,264 --> 00:32:37,634
Save me, sister!

177
00:32:39,198 --> 00:32:40,628
Protect me, brother!

178
00:32:42,298 --> 00:32:48,688
From yonder mountain Fasolt would
come to force me away

179
00:32:52,431 --> 00:32:55,121
Let him threaten!
Did you not see Loge?

180
00:32:56,264 --> 00:33:00,624
You always trust that trickster!
Much harm he's already done us ...

181
00:33:02,131 --> 00:33:04,001
... yet ever again he ensnares you

182
00:33:07,131 --> 00:33:11,291
When courage suffices
I ask none for help

183
00:33:13,631 --> 00:33:16,561
But to use foes' jealousy ...

184
00:33:20,864 --> 00:33:23,444
... only Loge's cunning will serve

185
00:33:25,697 --> 00:33:29,327
He promised to deliver Freia

186
00:33:31,264 --> 00:33:32,964
I now rely on him

187
00:33:34,331 --> 00:33:36,231
And he forsakes you!

188
00:33:37,931 --> 00:33:42,121
The giants approach
Where loiters your helper?

189
00:33:45,931 --> 00:33:48,071
Where linger my brothers ...

190
00:33:48,931 --> 00:33:53,711
... who should bring help, since
my brother-in-law abandons me?

191
00:33:58,731 --> 00:34:03,861
Donner, help! Come hither, Froh!

192
00:34:06,931 --> 00:34:11,381
They who betrayed you
have all gone to ground

193
00:34:38,197 --> 00:34:43,177
Sleep sealed your eyes ...

194
00:34:45,597 --> 00:34:52,107
... while we two built the fort

195
00:34:56,531 --> 00:35:05,091
Toiling yet untiring,
we heaped up massive stones

196
00:35:16,831 --> 00:35:20,341
There stands what we raised ...

197
00:35:23,464 --> 00:35:27,534
... brightly shining in
the light of day

198
00:35:30,597 --> 00:35:36,927
Now pass in and pay us our fee

199
00:35:46,497 --> 00:35:50,277
Name your price, my men

200
00:35:56,131 --> 00:35:59,881
Is your memory so weak?

201
00:36:05,097 --> 00:36:10,457
Freia the fair ...

202
00:36:13,431 --> 00:36:15,951
... it was agreed we should
take home

203
00:36:17,464 --> 00:36:21,244
Think of some other reward

204
00:36:36,464 --> 00:36:41,154
Are you planning treachery?

205
00:36:45,431 --> 00:36:52,521
Are the marks of solemn compact
on your spear but sport to you?

206
00:36:54,897 --> 00:37:00,227
Brother, do you see the swindle?

207
00:37:05,064 --> 00:37:06,704
Son of light, beware!

208
00:37:12,297 --> 00:37:14,437
Hold firm to your bond!

209
00:37:18,531 --> 00:37:22,511
What you are,
you are only by contracts

210
00:37:26,664 --> 00:37:29,414
Limited and defined is your power

211
00:37:31,397 --> 00:37:34,437
You have more wisdom than we

212
00:37:37,164 --> 00:37:39,334
You bound us to keep peace

213
00:37:42,164 --> 00:37:47,814
I will curse all your wisdom
and flee from your peace ...

214
00:37:51,231 --> 00:37:56,831
... if you do not keep your bond!

215
00:38:04,164 --> 00:38:11,404
A simple giant thus counsels you.
Wise one, weigh his words!

216
00:38:17,931 --> 00:38:22,791
How cunning to take in earnest
what was agreed only in jest

217
00:38:27,097 --> 00:38:32,487
The lovely goddess,
of what use is her charm to you?

218
00:38:36,364 --> 00:38:38,144
Do you mock us?

219
00:38:42,964 --> 00:38:46,654
You, who rule by beauty ...

220
00:38:49,664 --> 00:38:56,694
... radiant race, foolishly you
strive for towers of stone ...

221
00:39:00,264 --> 00:39:06,714
... and pledge woman's beauty!

222
00:39:15,597 --> 00:39:22,597
We toil away
to win a winsome woman ...

223
00:39:25,630 --> 00:39:33,750
... who will live with
us poor creatures

224
00:39:42,930 --> 00:39:46,440
And do you now upset our bargain?

225
00:39:53,630 --> 00:39:56,210
Cease your idle chatter!

226
00:39:57,264 --> 00:39:59,954
Custody of Freia serves little ...

227
00:40:01,897 --> 00:40:05,087
... but to carry her off
is worth much

228
00:40:07,897 --> 00:40:10,887
Golden apples grow in her garden

229
00:40:12,130 --> 00:40:15,700
Only she knows how to tend them

230
00:40:18,364 --> 00:40:26,304
By eating the fruit, her kindred
are endowed with eternal youth

231
00:40:30,397 --> 00:40:33,467
Sick and wan ...

232
00:40:36,330 --> 00:40:43,220
... they will waste away
if they are forced to forego Freia

233
00:40:48,030 --> 00:40:49,760
Let her be taken from their midst!

234
00:40:54,464 --> 00:40:56,044
Loge delays too long

235
00:40:58,097 --> 00:41:00,787
- Your answer!
- Another fee!

236
00:41:02,997 --> 00:41:04,547
Only Freia!

237
00:41:07,497 --> 00:41:08,987
Follow us!

238
00:41:11,697 --> 00:41:13,507
Help from these ruffians!

239
00:41:19,397 --> 00:41:21,507
To me, Freia!

240
00:41:26,464 --> 00:41:29,454
Froh will protect you

241
00:41:34,064 --> 00:41:39,544
Fasolt and Fafner, have you felt
my hammer's heavy blow?

242
00:41:41,797 --> 00:41:44,667
Why do you threaten?

243
00:41:47,497 --> 00:41:52,687
We only want our wages

244
00:41:57,764 --> 00:42:00,954
Many a time have I paid
giants their due

245
00:42:03,164 --> 00:42:06,764
The payment I'll weigh
in full measure

246
00:42:11,430 --> 00:42:14,270
Hold, hothead!

247
00:42:22,797 --> 00:42:29,977
My spearshaft protects bonds

248
00:42:35,930 --> 00:42:38,450
Spare your hammer's haft!

249
00:42:45,597 --> 00:42:49,257
Alas! Wotan forsakes me!

250
00:42:51,264 --> 00:42:55,984
Do I understand you, cruel man?

251
00:43:06,564 --> 00:43:07,764
Loge at last!

252
00:43:12,297 --> 00:43:15,547
Is this how you hasten
to right your evil bargain?

253
00:43:19,230 --> 00:43:20,960
What bargain?

254
00:43:26,197 --> 00:43:28,827
That which you contracted?

255
00:43:35,864 --> 00:43:38,614
House and hearth delight me not

256
00:43:40,564 --> 00:43:43,784
Donner and Froh
are dreaming of shelter

257
00:43:48,997 --> 00:43:54,767
A stately home was Wotan's wish

258
00:43:58,064 --> 00:44:04,574
House and court, hall and keep,
the glorious fortress now stands

259
00:44:07,297 --> 00:44:12,897
I made sure that all was solid

260
00:44:16,664 --> 00:44:19,444
I found Fasolt and Fafner reliable

261
00:44:21,697 --> 00:44:24,537
Every stone was firm in place

262
00:44:30,763 --> 00:44:33,723
I was not idle, as were many here!

263
00:44:42,030 --> 00:44:48,510
Take care how you betray
your only friend among the gods!

264
00:44:58,897 --> 00:45:00,887
Speak and counsel well!

265
00:45:07,530 --> 00:45:13,600
When those who built the castle
stipulated Freia as payment ...

266
00:45:20,497 --> 00:45:28,907
... I agreed because you undertook
to redeem the noble pledge

267
00:45:34,497 --> 00:45:39,597
To consider how to release her -
that I promised

268
00:45:45,297 --> 00:45:52,507
But how could I promise what never
existed nor could succeed?

269
00:45:56,397 --> 00:45:58,297
What a treacherous knave
you trusted!

270
00:45:59,030 --> 00:46:00,760
Your name is Loge. I call you liar

271
00:46:01,563 --> 00:46:02,963
I'll quench your fire!

272
00:46:04,230 --> 00:46:06,010
To cover their disgrace they
revile me

273
00:46:08,597 --> 00:46:10,437
Leave my friend in peace!

274
00:46:16,463 --> 00:46:23,173
Loge's counsel is of richer weight
when he delays in giving it

275
00:46:26,297 --> 00:46:30,217
- No delays! Pay up!
- We're waiting for our wages

276
00:46:38,230 --> 00:46:44,030
Listen, shifty one!
Where have you been roving?

277
00:46:46,463 --> 00:46:49,923
Ingratitude is always Loge's lot!

278
00:46:51,897 --> 00:46:56,057
Concerned but for you ...

279
00:46:59,730 --> 00:47:06,090
... I ransacked the earth
to find a substitute for Freia

280
00:47:15,597 --> 00:47:17,877
In vain I searched

281
00:47:22,697 --> 00:47:28,377
In the whole wide world
nothing is so rich ...

282
00:47:29,997 --> 00:47:36,087
... that a man will accept it in
lieu of woman's beauty and delight

283
00:48:03,297 --> 00:48:09,007
Wherever there is life and being,
in water, earth and air ...

284
00:48:10,830 --> 00:48:14,310
... I asked and sought of all ...

285
00:48:20,530 --> 00:48:25,860
... what would a man think mightier
than woman's beauty and delight?

286
00:48:38,997 --> 00:48:41,077
My question was derided

287
00:48:44,263 --> 00:48:52,643
Nothing gives up love
and womankind

288
00:49:08,330 --> 00:49:11,610
Only one I saw
had forsworn love for gold

289
00:49:23,363 --> 00:49:29,403
The Rhine's children
bewailed their plight to me

290
00:49:32,097 --> 00:49:36,487
The Nibelung, night-Alberich,
stole from them the Rhinegold

291
00:49:44,330 --> 00:49:49,980
He now esteems it
earth's most precious prize ...

292
00:49:51,697 --> 00:49:56,527
... greater than woman's grace

293
00:50:07,230 --> 00:50:12,180
The daughters appeal to you,
Wotan ...

294
00:50:15,463 --> 00:50:18,563
... to bring the thief to justice

295
00:50:22,296 --> 00:50:25,226
Give them the gold back ...

296
00:50:26,763 --> 00:50:31,153
... to remain their own for ever

297
00:50:45,463 --> 00:50:48,713
I promised them to tell you this

298
00:50:51,296 --> 00:50:53,546
Now Loge has kept his word

299
00:50:57,963 --> 00:51:00,573
You are mad, if not malicious!

300
00:51:04,163 --> 00:51:08,883
You see me in trouble myself.
How can I bring others help?

301
00:51:11,230 --> 00:51:16,240
I grudge the gnome this gold.
Much harm he has already done us

302
00:51:22,596 --> 00:51:28,456
New mischief will the Nibelung plot
if the gold gives him power

303
00:51:31,896 --> 00:51:33,766
You there, Loge!

304
00:51:35,563 --> 00:51:38,083
Of what great value is the gold?

305
00:51:47,196 --> 00:51:51,146
It is a toy for laughing children

306
00:51:56,396 --> 00:52:02,786
But were it fashioned into a ring
it would bestow supreme power ...

307
00:52:05,096 --> 00:52:08,136
... and win its master the world

308
00:52:12,196 --> 00:52:15,476
I have heard of the Rhine's gold

309
00:52:17,030 --> 00:52:21,540
Its glow hides runes of riches

310
00:52:24,463 --> 00:52:31,143
A ring would give unbounded power

311
00:52:40,963 --> 00:52:47,203
Would the glittering gems
serve as adornment for women?

312
00:52:49,630 --> 00:52:52,790
A wife could ensure
her husband's fidelity ...

313
00:52:55,830 --> 00:53:02,280
... with the ornament dwarfs forge,
toiling in the power of the ring

314
00:53:11,230 --> 00:53:15,040
Could my husband win this gold?

315
00:53:34,630 --> 00:53:38,970
To control this ring seems wise

316
00:53:46,430 --> 00:53:51,590
But how can I learn the art
of forging this gem?

317
00:53:54,963 --> 00:53:58,743
A spell turns the gold into a ring

318
00:54:02,263 --> 00:54:04,693
No one knows it

319
00:54:08,196 --> 00:54:18,686
But anyone can acquire it
who renounces love

320
00:54:23,530 --> 00:54:26,190
That you will not. You are too late

321
00:54:27,996 --> 00:54:29,516
Alberich did not hesitate

322
00:54:31,096 --> 00:54:34,026
He gained the power of the spell

323
00:54:36,063 --> 00:54:39,983
The ring became his!

324
00:54:45,296 --> 00:54:48,696
The dwarf will control us all ...

325
00:54:51,030 --> 00:54:52,810
... if the ring is not
wrested from him

326
00:54:54,763 --> 00:54:56,983
I must have the ring!

327
00:54:58,330 --> 00:55:02,870
It is easily won without
cursing love

328
00:55:06,396 --> 00:55:07,446
Child's play!

329
00:55:08,963 --> 00:55:10,543
- Tell us, how?
- Theft!

330
00:55:15,530 --> 00:55:18,570
What a thief stole,
you steal from the thief

331
00:55:22,763 --> 00:55:24,903
Could possessions
be more easily acquired?

332
00:55:29,296 --> 00:55:31,486
But Alberich guards with guile

333
00:55:33,596 --> 00:55:38,226
You must act subtly to return ...

334
00:55:40,896 --> 00:55:44,586
... the Rhinemaidens' gold ...

335
00:55:49,029 --> 00:55:52,839
... for that is what they beg

336
00:55:55,963 --> 00:55:58,773
Rhinemaidens?
What is this to me?

337
00:56:02,096 --> 00:56:08,336
I wish to know nothing of them.
Many a man, to my sorrow ...

338
00:56:10,029 --> 00:56:13,019
... have they lured
with their sport

339
00:56:25,796 --> 00:56:32,686
That gold is worth more than Freia

340
00:56:40,163 --> 00:56:45,523
Eternal youth he gains
who commands it by gold's magic

341
00:57:14,729 --> 00:57:18,329
Hear, Wotan, what we have to say!

342
00:57:20,863 --> 00:57:24,733
Freia may stay with you in peace

343
00:57:32,596 --> 00:57:40,216
We giants would be satisfied
with the Nibelung's gold

344
00:57:44,263 --> 00:57:47,663
Can I give you what I do not own?

345
00:57:51,196 --> 00:57:55,616
The castle was hard to build

346
00:58:00,563 --> 00:58:05,663
It will be easy for you with craft
to fetter the Nibelung firmly

347
00:58:10,396 --> 00:58:15,346
Shall I exert myself
to fetter the foe for you?

348
00:58:26,096 --> 00:58:30,576
Come, girl! Follow us
till we receive your ransom

349
00:58:39,863 --> 00:58:44,173
Till evening we will hold
her as hostage

350
00:58:45,963 --> 00:58:48,073
We shall return

351
00:58:49,329 --> 00:58:53,669
If as ransom the Rhinegold
is not ready ...

352
00:58:55,963 --> 00:58:59,943
... she will go with us for ever!

353
00:59:02,663 --> 00:59:04,773
Sister! Brothers! Help!

354
00:59:06,196 --> 00:59:08,216
- After them!
- Let us break everything!

355
00:59:10,129 --> 00:59:11,679
Save me!

356
00:59:17,596 --> 00:59:19,466
Over stock and stone
they stride ...

357
00:59:23,163 --> 00:59:25,943
... through the ford
across the Rhine

358
00:59:33,896 --> 00:59:38,936
Heia! How the louts lurch along!

359
00:59:41,563 --> 00:59:44,693
Only at Riesenheim will they pause

360
00:59:52,763 --> 00:59:55,253
On what does Wotan brood?

361
01:00:03,563 --> 01:00:08,133
How goes it
with the glorious gods?

362
01:00:18,129 --> 01:00:19,909
Does a mist deceive me?

363
01:00:29,763 --> 01:00:34,653
How anxious and pale
you've become!

364
01:00:44,963 --> 01:00:48,033
The light has faded
from your eyes!

365
01:00:53,496 --> 01:00:57,476
Courage, Froh,
it is but early yet!

366
01:01:00,129 --> 01:01:02,619
From your hand the hammer falls!

367
01:01:08,996 --> 01:01:10,366
How is it with Fricka?

368
01:01:15,629 --> 01:01:20,669
Is she displeased
with Wotan's grey gloom?

369
01:01:30,429 --> 01:01:35,259
Alas! What has happened?

370
01:01:40,596 --> 01:01:43,026
My hand drops

371
01:01:46,662 --> 01:01:49,002
My heart falters

372
01:02:02,996 --> 01:02:05,486
Hear what it is you lack!

373
01:02:10,096 --> 01:02:15,576
You have not yet eaten
Freia's fruit

374
01:02:20,696 --> 01:02:27,906
The golden apples in her garden ...

375
01:02:31,362 --> 01:02:35,812
... made you hearty and young ...

376
01:02:38,129 --> 01:02:42,519
... when you ate them every day

377
01:02:46,996 --> 01:02:50,746
She is now a hostage

378
01:02:53,129 --> 01:02:59,429
On the branches the fruit withers

379
01:03:09,429 --> 01:03:14,529
It irks me less.
To me Freia was always niggardly

380
01:03:19,962 --> 01:03:23,652
I am only half as godlike
as you glorious ones!

381
01:03:30,929 --> 01:03:36,169
But you staked all on the fruit.
This the giants knew well

382
01:03:44,696 --> 01:03:47,506
Without the apples ...

383
01:03:49,529 --> 01:03:56,479
... old, grey, and haggard,
the scorn of all the world ...

384
01:04:00,862 --> 01:04:06,572
... the race of gods will die!

385
01:04:14,962 --> 01:04:20,322
Wotan, husband, unhappy man!

386
01:04:24,329 --> 01:04:29,899
See how your thoughtlessness
has brought disgrace on us all

387
01:04:44,229 --> 01:04:49,799
Loge, come down to Nibelheim

388
01:04:53,129 --> 01:04:55,529
I will procure the gold

389
01:04:57,096 --> 01:05:02,746
The Rhinemaidens appealed to you.
Can they hope for a hearing?

390
01:05:04,162 --> 01:05:09,932
Silence! We must deliver Freia

391
01:05:11,896 --> 01:05:15,146
As you command,
I will lead you down.

392
01:05:16,729 --> 01:05:21,509
- Shall we go through the Rhine?
- Not through the Rhine!

393
01:05:22,896 --> 01:05:26,736
Through the sulphurous cleft?
Slip into it with me!

394
01:05:42,462 --> 01:05:46,002
Wait here till evening

395
01:05:50,196 --> 01:05:58,546
Our loss of youth
I'll banish with redeeming gold!

396
01:06:02,062 --> 01:06:04,812
- Farewell, Wotan!
- Good luck!

397
01:06:06,462 --> 01:06:09,272
Return soon to your anxious wife!

398
01:09:00,329 --> 01:09:03,399
Come here, crafty dwarf!
You shall be pitilessly pinched ...

399
01:09:04,495 --> 01:09:07,485
... if you haven't finished
the fine-wrought gold on time

400
01:09:11,095 --> 01:09:15,225
Let me go! It's ready as ordered

401
01:09:19,329 --> 01:09:23,459
- Why are you so slow to show it?
- Lest something was lacking

402
01:09:25,162 --> 01:09:27,272
- What is not ready?
- Here ... and there

403
01:09:28,462 --> 01:09:29,832
Give me the work!

404
01:09:52,295 --> 01:09:56,075
See, scoundrel,
everything finished!

405
01:09:58,229 --> 01:10:00,859
Did the simpleton seek
to deceive ...

406
01:10:02,695 --> 01:10:07,055
... and keep for himself the object
my craft taught him how to forge?

407
01:10:23,129 --> 01:10:29,109
The helmet fits.
Will the spell work too?

408
01:10:33,595 --> 01:10:38,075
"Night and mist, like to no one!"

409
01:10:46,195 --> 01:10:47,805
Can you see me, brother?

410
01:10:50,462 --> 01:10:52,242
Where are you? I cannot see you

411
01:10:54,129 --> 01:10:57,349
Then feel me, rascal! Take that
for your thieving thoughts!

412
01:11:03,562 --> 01:11:07,042
Thank you, stupid!
Your work has stood the test

413
01:11:13,629 --> 01:11:16,969
Nibelungs, bow down to Alberich!

414
01:11:18,762 --> 01:11:22,802
Now he is watching you everywhere
and rest is refused you

415
01:11:24,562 --> 01:11:27,632
Work for him though he is unseen

416
01:11:28,795 --> 01:11:31,755
You are his vassals for ever!

417
01:11:36,362 --> 01:11:39,792
Listen for him, he is near,
the Lord of the Nibelungs

418
01:12:23,495 --> 01:12:27,505
Here is Nibelheim.
What fiery sparks are flashing?

419
01:12:33,962 --> 01:12:36,392
What is that among the rocks?

420
01:12:39,062 --> 01:12:40,762
Why are you whimpering?

421
01:12:44,495 --> 01:12:47,805
Hey, Mime! What torments you so?

422
01:12:50,295 --> 01:12:51,995
Leave me in peace!

423
01:12:53,728 --> 01:12:57,768
More yet, I would help you, Mime!

424
01:13:07,362 --> 01:13:15,162
I must obey my own brother
who brought these bonds on me

425
01:13:17,828 --> 01:13:20,228
What gave him the power
to bind you?

426
01:13:24,595 --> 01:13:31,655
Cunning Alberich wrought himself
a ring from the Rhine's gold

427
01:13:40,395 --> 01:13:46,545
With it he has overcome us,
the Nibelungs' nocturnal race

428
01:13:50,895 --> 01:13:59,075
Carefree smiths, once we created
ornaments for our women ...

429
01:14:04,562 --> 01:14:08,192
... and lightly laughed at our work

430
01:14:13,228 --> 01:14:20,498
This villain compels us to creep
into caverns and toil for him

431
01:14:24,062 --> 01:14:29,012
Through the ring his greed divines
where a new gleam is concealed

432
01:14:31,795 --> 01:14:36,655
We have to dig it out, melt the
booty and forge the cast ...

433
01:14:41,428 --> 01:14:46,498
... to pile up our master's hoard

434
01:14:53,295 --> 01:14:55,075
Your idleness brought on his ire?

435
01:14:58,962 --> 01:15:02,302
On me he forced the heaviest task

436
01:15:05,895 --> 01:15:08,855
He bade me forge and weld a helmet

437
01:15:18,728 --> 01:15:23,738
I noted what power
lay in the work I fashioned

438
01:15:25,928 --> 01:15:30,618
I wanted to keep the helmet
and escape from Alberich's sway ...

439
01:15:33,462 --> 01:15:37,472
... perhaps get him in my power ...

440
01:15:39,295 --> 01:15:44,745
... and snatch the ring so that
I might be free and he my slave!

441
01:15:51,562 --> 01:15:53,022
Why did you not succeed?

442
01:15:55,528 --> 01:15:57,428
Though I fashioned the work ...

443
01:16:00,195 --> 01:16:05,495
... I did not guess
the spell aright

444
01:16:12,462 --> 01:16:16,382
He who planned the work
and snatched it from me ...

445
01:16:18,762 --> 01:16:23,302
... has taught me
what cunning lay in the helmet

446
01:16:25,362 --> 01:16:29,722
He vanished from my sight,
but unseen his arm raised weals

447
01:16:32,962 --> 01:16:36,472
That's what thanks I earned!

448
01:16:45,495 --> 01:16:49,475
- Our capture will not be easy
- He will fall with your cunning

449
01:16:54,228 --> 01:16:57,188
Who are you, then, strangers?

450
01:16:58,495 --> 01:17:02,035
Friends. We will free the Nibelungs

451
01:17:10,762 --> 01:17:12,752
Beware! Alberich draws near

452
01:17:15,728 --> 01:17:19,538
We'll wait here for him

453
01:17:26,495 --> 01:17:29,185
Idle herd, pile up the hoard!

454
01:17:35,662 --> 01:17:38,822
Put down the treasure!
Must I help?

455
01:17:44,962 --> 01:17:46,482
Who is there?

456
01:17:47,995 --> 01:17:51,805
Here, scamp! Have you
been chattering to these tramps?

457
01:17:52,928 --> 01:17:55,268
Be off, idler! Back to your bench!

458
01:17:58,061 --> 01:18:02,421
Out of here, all of you!
Find me gold from the new veins!

459
01:18:05,595 --> 01:18:09,955
My whip waits
for those that don't dig deep!

460
01:18:16,695 --> 01:18:21,295
I am everywhere
though none can tell where

461
01:18:27,028 --> 01:18:32,298
Are you still lingering?
Still loitering?

462
01:18:45,261 --> 01:18:48,281
Tremble, abject throng!

463
01:18:51,528 --> 01:18:56,688
Obey the master of the ring!

464
01:19:29,828 --> 01:19:31,378
What do you want here?

465
01:19:34,628 --> 01:19:41,778
From Nibelheim's land of night
we have heard new rumours

466
01:19:45,261 --> 01:19:51,121
Mighty marvels Alberich works.
Greed brought us as guests to gorge

467
01:19:58,395 --> 01:20:01,905
Envy led you, that I well know

468
01:20:04,095 --> 01:20:08,635
Do you know me well?
Who am I that you should snarl?

469
01:20:10,195 --> 01:20:15,825
In your cave Loge smiled on you,
gave light and warming flames ...

470
01:20:18,095 --> 01:20:20,495
... and fired your forge

471
01:20:24,528 --> 01:20:27,838
I am your kinsman, was your friend.
You show little thanks

472
01:20:30,928 --> 01:20:34,848
Loge smiles now with elves of light

473
01:20:38,061 --> 01:20:41,931
If, false one, you're their friend
as you once were mine ...

474
01:20:47,861 --> 01:20:49,121
... I have nothing to fear

475
01:20:50,428 --> 01:20:55,318
- You can have faith in me
- In faithlessness not fidelity

476
01:20:59,128 --> 01:21:01,558
But dauntlessly I defy you all!

477
01:21:04,095 --> 01:21:06,025
Your power lends you assurance

478
01:21:08,528 --> 01:21:10,458
Great has grown your strength

479
01:21:12,128 --> 01:21:14,678
Do you see the hoard heaped up?

480
01:21:17,195 --> 01:21:19,155
I never yet saw one so enviable

481
01:21:21,628 --> 01:21:28,598
That is today's paltry pile.
It will increase in the future

482
01:21:32,895 --> 01:21:35,995
But Nibelheim is joyless ...

483
01:21:37,328 --> 01:21:43,308
... and treasure can buy nothing

484
01:21:46,495 --> 01:21:51,595
Nibelheim's night serves me
to create and conceal treasure

485
01:21:56,961 --> 01:22:03,031
With the hoard in the cave
I intend to work wonders

486
01:22:07,295 --> 01:22:10,895
I will win the world for my own

487
01:22:17,328 --> 01:22:19,758
How will you start on that?

488
01:22:26,761 --> 01:22:33,151
You who aloft in the breeze
live, laugh and love ...

489
01:22:39,961 --> 01:22:44,321
... all you gods I'll grip
in my golden grasp!

490
01:22:55,561 --> 01:23:00,781
As I renounced love ...

491
01:23:06,495 --> 01:23:11,295
... all shall renounce it!

492
01:23:16,595 --> 01:23:21,925
Allured by gold,
for gold alone shall you hunger

493
01:23:33,328 --> 01:23:40,538
On radiant peaks you live in bliss

494
01:23:50,328 --> 01:23:57,388
The black gnome you despise,
you eternal revellers!

495
01:24:09,628 --> 01:24:10,888
Beware!

496
01:24:17,061 --> 01:24:23,741
When you men serve my might the
dwarf will take his pleasure ...

497
01:24:27,994 --> 01:24:31,974
... with your pretty women,
though love does not smile on him

498
01:24:37,261 --> 01:24:38,431
Did you hear?

499
01:24:42,294 --> 01:24:45,924
Beware when the Nibelung horde ...

500
01:24:48,061 --> 01:24:53,511
... rises from the depths
to the light!

501
01:25:00,128 --> 01:25:01,648
- Blasphemous fool!
- What?

502
01:25:02,494 --> 01:25:03,484
Keep your head!

503
01:25:06,094 --> 01:25:12,544
Faced with Alberich's work
who would not feel wonder?

504
01:25:16,461 --> 01:25:20,561
If you win, with your treasure,
all you demand ...

505
01:25:23,294 --> 01:25:25,904
... I must acclaim you
the mightiest

506
01:25:28,094 --> 01:25:31,524
Moon, stars, and radiant sun ...

507
01:25:32,828 --> 01:25:36,338
... can do no other but serve you

508
01:25:41,328 --> 01:25:42,228
But ...

509
01:25:46,294 --> 01:25:51,594
... I deem it significant
that those who heap the hoard ...

510
01:25:55,161 --> 01:25:59,081
... obey you ungrudgingly

511
01:26:03,694 --> 01:26:06,654
Boldly you fingered a ring ...

512
01:26:11,794 --> 01:26:16,074
... before which they trembled

513
01:26:21,161 --> 01:26:25,941
But if a thief by stealth ...

514
01:26:27,794 --> 01:26:30,924
... snatched the ring?

515
01:26:34,761 --> 01:26:39,181
How would you guard yourself?

516
01:26:42,861 --> 01:26:46,641
Loge thinks himself most artful

517
01:26:49,328 --> 01:26:53,838
Others seem stupid to him

518
01:26:57,861 --> 01:27:05,301
That I should need his counsel,
the thief would rejoice to hear

519
01:27:11,328 --> 01:27:16,598
I conceived the concealing helmet
and had Mime fashion it for me

520
01:27:26,861 --> 01:27:31,281
The helmet allows me
to change my shape at will

521
01:27:39,261 --> 01:27:43,891
No one can see me, yet I am
everywhere

522
01:27:52,928 --> 01:27:59,458
I can live safe even from you ...

523
01:28:02,894 --> 01:28:06,054
... kind, considerate friend!

524
01:28:12,628 --> 01:28:17,788
I have seen many strange things,
but never witnessed such a wonder

525
01:28:22,761 --> 01:28:24,901
I cannot credit this unique work

526
01:28:26,594 --> 01:28:30,514
Were this possible,
your power would last for ever

527
01:28:32,961 --> 01:28:37,301
- Do you think I lie like Loge?
- Until I see for myself

528
01:28:39,628 --> 01:28:41,468
The fool is bursting with wisdom

529
01:28:43,794 --> 01:28:47,664
Now may envy devour you!
In what shape shall I appear?

530
01:28:49,294 --> 01:28:50,144
Whatever you will

531
01:28:51,928 --> 01:28:53,828
Strike me dumb with astonishment!

532
01:29:07,827 --> 01:29:12,657
Giant serpent, curl and coil!

533
01:30:07,427 --> 01:30:12,377
Oh, do not swallow me!
Spare Loge's life!

534
01:30:14,894 --> 01:30:20,664
Good, you villain! How quickly
the dwarf turned to a dragon!

535
01:30:38,794 --> 01:30:41,604
Do you believe me now?

536
01:30:43,794 --> 01:30:46,864
My trembling testifies to it

537
01:30:52,561 --> 01:30:55,811
Now that I have seen it
I readily believe the marvel

538
01:31:01,127 --> 01:31:05,047
But can you make yourself tiny?

539
01:31:07,794 --> 01:31:09,904
That would be the subtle way
to escape danger

540
01:31:11,427 --> 01:31:13,157
But that would be too hard!

541
01:31:16,994 --> 01:31:18,074
How small shall I be?

542
01:31:19,494 --> 01:31:23,034
So that a crevice might hold you
where a toad timidly hides

543
01:31:24,594 --> 01:31:25,444
Nothing simpler!

544
01:31:28,094 --> 01:31:29,844
Watch me!

545
01:31:38,161 --> 01:31:42,171
Crawl, crooked grey toad!

546
01:32:05,394 --> 01:32:07,234
Seize it quickly!

547
01:32:10,427 --> 01:32:13,467
- I am captured!
- Hold him till I tie him!

548
01:32:19,727 --> 01:32:22,007
Up we go. There he will be ours

549
01:36:05,094 --> 01:36:06,614
Sit tight there, kinsman!

550
01:36:08,860 --> 01:36:14,020
Look, there lies the world
that you wanted to win

551
01:36:17,260 --> 01:36:21,270
What spot, tell me,
will you allow for my sty?

552
01:36:28,494 --> 01:36:36,584
Rogue! Ruffian! Loosen my
bonds or you'll rue this outrage!

553
01:36:40,460 --> 01:36:43,740
You are caught in my chains

554
01:36:46,860 --> 01:36:52,870
You fancied the world lay
in your power

555
01:37:01,760 --> 01:37:05,040
Wretch, you cannot deny it!

556
01:37:07,227 --> 01:37:10,597
To free you a ransom is demanded

557
01:37:12,360 --> 01:37:18,660
Dolt I am, to trust this trick!
Terrible vengeance I vow!

558
01:37:21,627 --> 01:37:24,147
First you must set yourself free

559
01:37:27,094 --> 01:37:30,904
To a fettered man
no free soul makes amends

560
01:37:35,327 --> 01:37:39,487
If you relish thoughts of revenge,
first think about the ransom

561
01:37:46,027 --> 01:37:50,217
- Say what it is you want
- The treasure and your gold

562
01:37:52,927 --> 01:37:54,947
Greedy gang of rogues!

563
01:37:57,994 --> 01:38:01,744
But if I keep the ring
I could spare the treasure

564
01:38:04,927 --> 01:38:09,647
New wealth would soon be won
at the ring's command

565
01:38:11,327 --> 01:38:17,007
I shall not pay too dear
if the lesson costs only baubles

566
01:38:22,727 --> 01:38:27,477
- Will you yield the treasure?
- Loosen my hand and I'll summon it

567
01:39:01,960 --> 01:39:04,710
I have called the Nibelungs

568
01:39:08,294 --> 01:39:12,394
I hear them hauling
the hoard from the depths

569
01:39:16,427 --> 01:39:17,687
Now loosen my bonds!

570
01:39:19,427 --> 01:39:22,037
Not until all has been paid

571
01:39:43,460 --> 01:39:47,410
Oh humiliation that my slaves
should see me captive!

572
01:39:50,994 --> 01:39:55,354
Bring it in as I command!
Pile the hoard into a heap!

573
01:39:57,727 --> 01:40:00,887
Don't glance over here!
Quick there, quick

574
01:40:03,793 --> 01:40:05,983
Then get back to your labour!

575
01:40:08,793 --> 01:40:12,693
Woe betide if I find you idle!
I am following at your heels

576
01:40:47,593 --> 01:40:50,053
I have paid. Now let me depart

577
01:40:53,127 --> 01:40:58,397
And the helmet that Loge holds,
now kindly give back to me

578
01:41:02,393 --> 01:41:04,143
This belongs to the ransom

579
01:41:05,493 --> 01:41:07,013
Accursed thief!

580
01:41:09,893 --> 01:41:11,533
But patience!

581
01:41:12,927 --> 01:41:15,037
He who made it can make another

582
01:41:17,127 --> 01:41:19,467
Mine is the might that Mime obeys

583
01:41:21,993 --> 01:41:28,943
Yet it's hard to leave
my weapon to my foes

584
01:41:38,960 --> 01:41:43,940
Alberich has left you everything.
Now, bullies, loosen my bonds!

585
01:41:45,760 --> 01:41:48,600
Shall I untie him?

586
01:41:52,127 --> 01:41:55,257
A golden ring rests on your finger

587
01:41:56,893 --> 01:42:00,873
- That belongs to the hoard
- The ring?

588
01:42:03,293 --> 01:42:09,093
- To be freed you must forfeit it
- My life, but not the ring!

589
01:42:11,327 --> 01:42:14,667
I require the ring.
With your life do what you will!

590
01:42:16,260 --> 01:42:19,690
I lose limb and life
if I must lose the ring too

591
01:42:21,360 --> 01:42:26,110
Hand and head, eye and ear
are not more my own than this!

592
01:42:31,793 --> 01:42:34,693
You call the ring your own?

593
01:42:36,293 --> 01:42:38,483
Are you raving, shameless gnome?

594
01:42:40,360 --> 01:42:45,580
From whom did you take the gold
from which you made the ring?

595
01:42:48,293 --> 01:42:53,563
Was it your own,
that you stole it from the depths?

596
01:42:56,427 --> 01:42:58,157
Ask the Rhine's daughters ...

597
01:43:01,760 --> 01:43:04,980
... whether they gave you
the gold you robbed

598
01:43:08,860 --> 01:43:12,340
Base trickery! Vile deceit!

599
01:43:14,960 --> 01:43:19,380
Do you throw on me the blame
for what you so dearly desired?

600
01:43:22,093 --> 01:43:26,013
Gladly you would have robbed
the Rhine of its gold ...

601
01:43:27,793 --> 01:43:31,603
... had you so easily
found the way to forge it!

602
01:43:35,327 --> 01:43:38,457
How well it worked for you ...

603
01:43:40,160 --> 01:43:45,110
... that I, in shame and fury ...

604
01:43:46,860 --> 01:43:52,080
... gained the terrible magic
whose work now gladdens you!

605
01:43:56,093 --> 01:44:00,483
Must this fatal, fearful deed ...

606
01:44:02,260 --> 01:44:09,120
... serve you as a royal toy,
my curse serve for your pleasure?

607
01:44:14,360 --> 01:44:18,020
Take heed, haughty god!

608
01:44:24,660 --> 01:44:27,730
If I sinned it was against myself

609
01:44:31,293 --> 01:44:36,653
But you sin against all that was,
is and shall be ...

610
01:44:39,827 --> 01:44:41,607
... if you seize my ring!

611
01:44:44,393 --> 01:44:46,003
Surrender the ring!

612
01:44:48,427 --> 01:44:52,207
No right to it can you prove

613
01:45:08,127 --> 01:45:10,437
Crushed!

614
01:45:13,660 --> 01:45:14,680
Shattered!

615
01:45:16,827 --> 01:45:23,187
Of wretches the wretchedest slave!

616
01:45:31,160 --> 01:45:37,520
Now I possess what will make me
the mightiest of mighty lords!

617
01:45:53,493 --> 01:45:54,343
Is he to go?

618
01:45:56,126 --> 01:45:57,466
Set him free!

619
01:46:11,893 --> 01:46:16,643
Slink off home! No knot holds you

620
01:46:22,826 --> 01:46:25,436
Am I free?

621
01:46:31,993 --> 01:46:35,333
Truly free?

622
01:46:44,593 --> 01:46:50,663
Then thus I give you
my freedom's first greeting!

623
01:47:02,660 --> 01:47:10,660
Since by curse it came to me,
accursed be this ring!

624
01:47:17,526 --> 01:47:21,686
Since its gold gave me might ...

625
01:47:25,126 --> 01:47:30,896
... may its magic bring death
to whoever wears it!

626
01:47:34,660 --> 01:47:38,670
It shall gladden no happy man

627
01:47:41,193 --> 01:47:45,413
Its gleam shall light
on no one lucky!

628
01:47:53,926 --> 01:47:58,086
Whoever possesses it
shall be consumed with care ...

629
01:48:00,160 --> 01:48:04,290
... whoever has it not
shall be gnawed with envy!

630
01:48:09,226 --> 01:48:16,666
Each shall itch to possess it,
but none shall find in it pleasure!

631
01:48:19,060 --> 01:48:22,630
Its owner shall guard it
profitlessly

632
01:48:24,793 --> 01:48:28,633
Through it he shall
meet his executioner!

633
01:48:32,193 --> 01:48:38,403
Forfeit to death, faint with fear
shall he be fettered

634
01:48:40,893 --> 01:48:45,523
The length of his life
he shall long to die ...

635
01:48:47,626 --> 01:48:53,226
... the ring's master to
the ring a slave ...

636
01:49:00,693 --> 01:49:08,543
... until again I hold
in my hand what was stolen!

637
01:49:23,326 --> 01:49:27,166
Thus in direst distress ...

638
01:49:30,160 --> 01:49:35,020
... the Nibelung blesses his ring!

639
01:49:46,493 --> 01:49:51,653
Keep it now, guard it well!

640
01:49:55,326 --> 01:50:00,896
My curse you cannot escape!

641
01:50:34,493 --> 01:50:38,363
Did you heed his fond farewell?

642
01:50:41,593 --> 01:50:43,993
Let him give vent to his fury

643
01:51:25,759 --> 01:51:27,689
Fasolt and Fafner are approaching

644
01:51:31,959 --> 01:51:34,919
They are bringing Freia back

645
01:51:58,359 --> 01:52:02,549
- They have returned
- Welcome, brother!

646
01:52:04,859 --> 01:52:06,999
Do you bring good tidings?

647
01:52:09,093 --> 01:52:14,073
We carried out the task.
There lies what will free Freia

648
01:52:18,959 --> 01:52:23,529
From the giants' grasp
our fair one approaches

649
01:52:26,826 --> 01:52:31,336
The breeze breathes on us again

650
01:52:33,726 --> 01:52:38,236
Bliss fills our senses

651
01:52:40,659 --> 01:52:48,919
It would be gloomy to be
for ever separated from her ...

652
01:52:53,926 --> 01:52:59,636
... who gives us perpetual youth
and joyous delight!

653
01:53:16,926 --> 01:53:23,166
Dearest sister!
Are you restored to me?

654
01:53:28,693 --> 01:53:34,553
Do not touch her!
She still belongs to us

655
01:53:40,759 --> 01:53:46,269
At Riesenheim's boundary
we stopped to rest

656
01:53:52,126 --> 01:53:56,576
Honourably we tended
the pledge for the pact

657
01:54:00,959 --> 01:54:06,729
I regret I am returning her ...

658
01:54:10,793 --> 01:54:16,533
... for us to be paid her ransom

659
01:54:21,426 --> 01:54:24,446
The ransom lies ready

660
01:54:26,059 --> 01:54:29,159
Now the gold shall be measured

661
01:54:39,459 --> 01:54:44,119
To do without the woman
saddens us sorely

662
01:54:47,293 --> 01:54:50,193
If she is to be
banished from my mind ...

663
01:54:52,693 --> 01:54:59,843
... the treasure must be so high
that it hides her from my sight!

664
01:55:15,559 --> 01:55:19,919
Freia's form shall be the measure

665
01:55:52,326 --> 01:55:58,536
These poles measure the pledge.
Now fill the space with the hoard

666
01:56:01,693 --> 01:56:03,503
Hurry! The work is repugnant!

667
01:56:05,726 --> 01:56:10,586
- Help me, Froh!
- I'll end Freia's shame

668
01:56:37,159 --> 01:56:38,769
Not so loosely packed!

669
01:56:46,559 --> 01:56:48,079
Fill the measure tightly!

670
01:56:51,526 --> 01:56:54,016
I can still see through it.
Stop up these chinks!

671
01:56:55,859 --> 01:56:57,499
Stand back, clod!

672
01:56:58,226 --> 01:57:01,156
- Keep your hands off!
- Close these crevices!

673
01:57:03,559 --> 01:57:05,549
Deep in me burns my disgrace

674
01:57:08,059 --> 01:57:11,049
Our pure one stands humiliated

675
01:57:13,826 --> 01:57:17,776
Her look mutely pleads for release

676
01:57:19,592 --> 01:57:25,362
Wicked man, to ask this
of a loved one!

677
01:57:28,426 --> 01:57:29,766
Still more!

678
01:57:32,392 --> 01:57:36,612
Rage this rogue rouses in me!

679
01:57:38,759 --> 01:57:43,009
You cur! If you want to measure,
measure yourself against me!

680
01:57:44,292 --> 01:57:48,272
Your din avails you nothing!

681
01:57:49,926 --> 01:57:51,066
Not even to crush you?

682
01:57:52,192 --> 01:57:53,182
Peace!

683
01:57:57,626 --> 01:57:59,586
I think Freia is covered now

684
01:58:03,659 --> 01:58:04,949
The hoard is used up

685
01:58:16,859 --> 01:58:20,549
I still see the gleam of her hair.
Throw that object on the pile!

686
01:58:21,759 --> 01:58:22,959
The helmet too?

687
01:58:23,659 --> 01:58:26,209
- Here with it!
- Let it go!

688
01:58:31,026 --> 01:58:33,136
Are you satisfied?

689
01:58:39,726 --> 01:58:45,526
Freia the fair I see no more

690
01:58:53,959 --> 01:58:55,599
Must I let her go?

691
01:59:18,959 --> 01:59:23,709
Her gaze still gleams on me here,
through a crack

692
01:59:29,826 --> 01:59:35,336
As long as I see those lovely eyes
I cannot tear myself away!

693
01:59:38,159 --> 01:59:39,939
I advise you, stop up this crack!

694
01:59:41,359 --> 01:59:44,929
Can't you see the gold has gone?

695
01:59:46,526 --> 01:59:48,956
By no means. On Wotan's finger ...

696
01:59:50,859 --> 01:59:54,759
... still glints a ring of gold.
Give it here to fill the crack!

697
01:59:55,859 --> 01:59:57,289
What! This ring?

698
01:59:58,692 --> 02:00:02,232
Listen! This gold belongs
to the Rhinemaidens

699
02:00:04,059 --> 02:00:06,399
Wotan will give it back to them

700
02:00:08,392 --> 02:00:14,132
What idle chatter is this?
What I won I'll keep for myself

701
02:00:17,526 --> 02:00:21,946
It goes badly with the promise
I gave the lamenting maidens

702
02:00:24,026 --> 02:00:26,956
Your promise does not bind me.
The ring remains with me

703
02:00:29,492 --> 02:00:31,512
But you must yield it here

704
02:00:33,292 --> 02:00:35,252
I will grant you everything ...

705
02:00:38,226 --> 02:00:41,036
... but for all the world
I will not surrender the ring!

706
02:00:44,126 --> 02:00:46,966
Then our first bargain stands.
Freia follows us for ever!

707
02:00:48,126 --> 02:00:50,736
- Help!
- Give in to them!

708
02:00:53,026 --> 02:00:55,606
- Do not hold back!
- Give up the ring!

709
02:00:58,259 --> 02:01:01,539
Leave me in peace!
The ring I'll not surrender

710
02:01:29,559 --> 02:01:34,719
Yield, Wotan, yield!

711
02:01:37,459 --> 02:01:40,919
Escape from the ring's curse

712
02:01:44,626 --> 02:01:49,346
To dark destruction ...

713
02:01:52,092 --> 02:01:55,902
... its possession dooms you

714
02:02:01,692 --> 02:02:05,472
Who is this woman who threatens?

715
02:02:12,392 --> 02:02:18,842
I know whatever was

716
02:02:26,125 --> 02:02:32,745
Whatever is, whatever shall be ...

717
02:02:36,492 --> 02:02:40,412
... I also see

718
02:02:45,259 --> 02:02:50,909
The eternal world's first
ancestress ...

719
02:02:56,725 --> 02:03:01,205
... Erda warns you

720
02:03:05,925 --> 02:03:12,895
My womb bore three daughters,
conceived before the start of time

721
02:03:19,925 --> 02:03:29,245
What I see, the Norns
nightly tell you

722
02:03:39,959 --> 02:03:47,049
But direst danger
today brings me in person to you

723
02:03:56,459 --> 02:03:59,479
Hear me!

724
02:04:12,759 --> 02:04:19,089
All that is shall come to an end

725
02:04:28,659 --> 02:04:34,579
A dark day dawns for the gods

726
02:04:41,592 --> 02:04:43,992
I charge you ...

727
02:04:45,892 --> 02:04:49,672
... shun the ring!

728
02:05:04,559 --> 02:05:11,999
Mysterious your words sound

729
02:05:20,325 --> 02:05:23,665
Stay that I may know more!

730
02:05:32,159 --> 02:05:35,699
I have warned you

731
02:05:38,625 --> 02:05:42,085
You know enough

732
02:05:45,225 --> 02:05:50,735
Reflect in fear and dread!

733
02:05:53,292 --> 02:05:56,752
If I must fear and dread,
I must seize you and learn all!

734
02:05:58,092 --> 02:05:59,322
What would you do, madman?

735
02:06:00,559 --> 02:06:06,889
Desist, Wotan! Touch not
the noble one. Heed her words!

736
02:06:18,959 --> 02:06:22,739
Listen, you giants! Wait!

737
02:06:24,959 --> 02:06:27,829
You shall be given the gold

738
02:06:30,992 --> 02:06:33,572
Dare I hope so?

739
02:06:37,159 --> 02:06:45,539
Do you think me
truly worth this ransom?

740
02:07:15,159 --> 02:07:17,769
Come to me, Freia!

741
02:07:20,659 --> 02:07:22,239
You are freed

742
02:07:25,259 --> 02:07:32,499
Bought back, restore our youth!

743
02:07:39,459 --> 02:07:41,979
You giants, take your ring!

744
02:08:21,225 --> 02:08:27,495
Stop, greedy! Leave some for me.
A fair division will be best

745
02:08:30,658 --> 02:08:33,938
You longed more for the maid than
for gold, lovesick loon!

746
02:08:35,225 --> 02:08:39,295
I persuaded you to exchange her.
You would not have shared Freia ...

747
02:08:40,658 --> 02:08:43,818
... so I retain more for myself

748
02:08:45,525 --> 02:08:47,925
Do you insult me?
I call on you as judges

749
02:08:49,592 --> 02:08:51,402
Divide the treasure between us

750
02:08:53,158 --> 02:08:56,118
Let him take the treasure.
Only keep the ring!

751
02:08:58,758 --> 02:09:02,448
Back! Mine is the ring!
For it I gave up Freia's gaze

752
02:09:03,692 --> 02:09:05,332
Hands away! The ring is mine!

753
02:09:07,925 --> 02:09:09,765
I hold it. It belongs to me!

754
02:09:11,058 --> 02:09:12,808
Hold it fast in case it falls!

755
02:09:24,258 --> 02:09:32,258
Now blink at Freia's gaze.
The ring you will not touch again!

756
02:10:01,525 --> 02:10:05,095
Terrible now I find the curse

757
02:10:33,092 --> 02:10:38,922
What luck, Wotan! Great your gain
when you won the ring

758
02:10:42,258 --> 02:10:44,428
More it profits now it is taken

759
02:10:48,792 --> 02:10:57,322
See, your foes fell each other
for the gold that you gave up

760
02:11:04,625 --> 02:11:08,525
Yet anxiety weighs upon me

761
02:11:14,092 --> 02:11:18,432
Dread and fear fetter my mind

762
02:11:23,958 --> 02:11:28,618
How to end it Erda must teach me

763
02:11:30,592 --> 02:11:33,372
I must go down to her

764
02:11:39,658 --> 02:11:43,788
Why do you tarry, Wotan?

765
02:11:54,525 --> 02:12:01,935
Does the noble fort not beckon
as it waits to welcome its owner?

766
02:12:05,758 --> 02:12:09,738
I paid for it with unclean wages!

767
02:12:28,925 --> 02:12:34,145
A sultry haze hangs in the air.
Its dull weight oppresses me

768
02:12:37,325 --> 02:12:42,245
I will collect the clouds
in a storm to sweep the sky

769
02:13:03,025 --> 02:13:10,615
Come to me, mists and vapours!
Donner, your master, summons you

770
02:13:20,658 --> 02:13:24,228
As I swing my hammer, hover here!

771
02:13:33,558 --> 02:13:36,168
Misty moisture, hanging haze!

772
02:13:38,591 --> 02:13:42,131
Donner, your master, summons you

773
02:14:36,091 --> 02:14:39,721
Brother, point out the path!

774
02:15:17,358 --> 02:15:20,488
The bridge leads to the fort ...

775
02:15:23,391 --> 02:15:28,371
... light but firm below your feet

776
02:15:30,158 --> 02:15:36,958
Boldly tread its terrorless path!

777
02:16:18,258 --> 02:16:23,268
The sun sheds its evening beams

778
02:16:29,625 --> 02:16:34,755
In its gleam the castle shines

779
02:16:44,925 --> 02:16:52,105
In the radiance of the morning
it stood tenantless ...

780
02:16:56,258 --> 02:17:01,498
... grand and inviting before me

781
02:17:07,858 --> 02:17:14,338
From morn to eve, in care
and anxiety ...

782
02:17:18,358 --> 02:17:24,508
... not lightly was it won

783
02:17:30,591 --> 02:17:33,371
Night draws on

784
02:17:36,725 --> 02:17:40,885
From envy it now offers shelter

785
02:17:55,858 --> 02:17:59,288
Thus I salute the fortress ...

786
02:18:01,725 --> 02:18:05,125
... safe from terror and dread

787
02:18:13,791 --> 02:18:16,401
Wife, follow me

788
02:18:18,758 --> 02:18:25,708
Dwell in Valhalla with me!

789
02:18:32,358 --> 02:18:36,988
What means the name?
Never have I heard it before

790
02:18:38,958 --> 02:18:43,058
What my courage found for me

791
02:18:47,991 --> 02:18:55,291
If it lives on victorious,
it will make its meaning plain

792
02:19:00,758 --> 02:19:04,068
They hasten to their end,
though they think themselves strong

793
02:19:06,258 --> 02:19:08,158
I am almost ashamed
to share their doings

794
02:19:09,858 --> 02:19:13,758
Fancy lures me to transform
myself back into flames

795
02:19:14,958 --> 02:19:18,708
To burn them who tamed me
rather than end with the blind!

796
02:19:22,124 --> 02:19:23,704
It doesn't seem stupid

797
02:19:25,191 --> 02:19:26,361
I'll think it over

798
02:19:27,591 --> 02:19:29,051
Who knows what I'll do?

799
02:19:42,658 --> 02:19:47,378
Rhinegold! Purest gold!

800
02:19:49,691 --> 02:19:52,791
How bright you once shone on us!

801
02:19:56,624 --> 02:20:00,084
What lamenting assails me here?

802
02:20:02,058 --> 02:20:04,198
Give us the gold!

803
02:20:06,158 --> 02:20:10,578
The children of the Rhine
lament their looted gold

804
02:20:12,958 --> 02:20:13,808
Accursed nymphs!

805
02:20:15,424 --> 02:20:18,734
Give us its glory again!

806
02:20:19,691 --> 02:20:21,181
Stop them annoying us!

807
02:20:23,558 --> 02:20:29,188
You in the water, why wail to us?
Hear what Wotan wills for you

808
02:20:31,958 --> 02:20:37,818
No more gleams the gold on you

809
02:20:40,691 --> 02:20:43,651
Henceforth bask in bliss ...

810
02:20:46,891 --> 02:20:48,621
... in the gods' new radiance!

811
02:20:57,958 --> 02:21:05,458
Rhinegold! If but your gleam
still glittered in the deep!

812
02:21:12,958 --> 02:21:19,728
Now only in the depths lie
tenderness and truth

813
02:21:25,624 --> 02:21:30,074
False and faint-hearted
are those who revel above!
